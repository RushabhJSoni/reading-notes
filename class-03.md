## Lists.

There are 3 types of lists.

- Ordered lists (``` <ol> ```)
  
  are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

- Unordered lists (```<ul>```)
  
  are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

- Definition lists (```<dl>```)
 
  are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

## CSS Box Model.

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
