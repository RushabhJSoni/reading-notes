## Images.

There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

## Selecting an image.

|        Image Should be         |      Stock Photos       | 
|         Be relevant            |
| Convey information             |     www.istockphoto.com |
| Convey the right mood          |    www.gettyimages.com  |
| Be instantly recognisable      |    www.veer.com         |
| Fit the color palette          |    www.sxc.hu           |


## Storing Images on your site.

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

## Adding Images.

Associated tag's.

```<img>```  - Self closing tag

``` src ```  - assigns a source/link to an image.

```alt```    - used for accesability so a text reader can be used on the website. 

## Color

Foreground Color


### RGB values

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

### Hex codes

These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

### Color names

There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

## Background Color

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
(covered on the next page).

## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

### TL;DR

Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.

### PNG

Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.

### Gif

Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
