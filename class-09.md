## Forms

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred 
to a printed document that contains 
spaces for you to fill in information

`<form>`

Form controls live inside a 
`<form>` element. This element 
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a 
method and id attribute too

### action

Every `<form>` element requires 
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the 
server that will receive the 
information in the form when it 
is submitted.
method
Forms can be sent using one of 
two methods: get or post.
With the get method, the values 
from the form are added to 
the end of the URL specified in 
the action attribute.
