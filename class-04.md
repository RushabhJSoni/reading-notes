## Links.

Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Layout.

In this chapter we are going to look at
how to control where each element sits
on a page and how to create attractive
page layouts.

## Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
