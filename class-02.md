## Text

HTML has six "levels" of headings:

```
<h1> Largest 
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>  To
<h5>
<h6> Smallest

```
- Paragraph <p>
To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening `<p>`
tag and closing `</p>` tag.
By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.

- **Bold** & _Italic_ ------------      `<b>` , `<i>`

- **White Space**
       In order to make code easier to
read, web page authors often
add extra spaces or start some
elements on new lines.
When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing.

- Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules------ `<br />` , `<hr />`

## Semantic Markup

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages

Strong & Emphasis ------------- `<strong>` , `<em>`

Quotations ------------`<blockquote>`, `<q>`

## CSS.

CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.

CSS code can be written in 3 ways:

  - Inline
  - Internal
  - External

## Basic JavaScript Instructions.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.


- MULTI-LINE COMMENTS
To write a comment that stretches over more than
one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with
the /* characters and ending with the * /

- SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS
In a single-line comment, anything that follows the
two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not
be processed by the JavaScript interpreter
