## Programing with JS

## Expressions and operators what are they?

JS has 10 different operators! they are.. 

- [Assignment operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators)
- [Comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators)
- [Arithmetic operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators)
- [Bitwise operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bitwise_operators)
- [Logical operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#logical_operators)
- [String operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#string_operators)
- [Conditional ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#conditional_ternary_operator)
- [Comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comma_operator)
- [Unary operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#unary_operators)
- [Relational operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#relational_operators)

## Operator precedence

The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. You can override operator precedence by using parentheses.

## Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

JavaScript has the following expression categories:

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)

- String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses  string operators.)

- Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)

- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.

- Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

## Functions!

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Control flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
