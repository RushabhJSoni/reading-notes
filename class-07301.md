1)Who is Roy Fielding?

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2)Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.


3)What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

4) What does a GET do?

GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

5)GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

6)What does PUT do?

PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

7)What does PATCH do?

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
