## **The Growth Mind Set**

In order to gorw and inculcate the mindset required to grow one must first begin with being _disciplined_ and  _persistant_. Always strive to impliment these two steps as they make learning easy.  
While being intelligent and talented are will only help you start strong but being disciplined and persistant will help one achive the ultimate **Growth Mind Set!**

> No Pain No Gain.

## How I plan on Achiving and maintaining the Growth Mind Set!

1. Always be ready to accept a challange
   - A challange is the best way to test one's knowlege and must be kept enjoyable.
2. Persistance
   - Keep tinkering away and you will achive your goal!
3. Discipline
   - In order to grow and be successfull there are no shortcuts and discipline helps make the entire task/learning very manageble.
