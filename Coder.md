# ***Coders Lair!***

This lesson was all about what it takes to set up the ideal coding environment for software devlopment.   
There are numerous tools available at our disposal and here are a few important one's with a brief discrption. 


## 1. The Terminal !         ![terminal logo](terminal.jpeg "Terminal") 
 _Terminals_, also known as command lines or consoles, allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the use of a graphical user interface. Using a terminal allows us to send simple text commands to our computer to do things like navigate through a directory or copy a file, and form the basis for many more complex automations and programming skills.

Eg commands: 
 - **cd** = Change directory
 - **ls** = List all files/folders
 - **pwd** = present working directory

## 2. Text Editor. 

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

## 3. Coding-Specific Text Editor.

Code editors or source code editors are the software that is designed specifically to help developers in coding. These are actually the text editors with some additional functionalities to manage and edit code.

Eg: _Sublime Text, Vs Code etc._

## 4. IDE

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program.

IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.
