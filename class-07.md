## Tables in Html

A table represents information in a grid format. 
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV 
schedules, and sports results

### Basic structure

`<table>`

The element is used 
to create a table. The contents 
of the table are written out row 
by row

`<tr>`

You indicate the start of each 
row using the opening tag. 
(The tr stands for table row.)

`<td>`

Each cell of a table is 
represented using a 
element. (The td stands for 
table data.)

`<th>`

The th element is used just 
like the td element but its 
purpose is to represent the 
heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table 
heading.)
