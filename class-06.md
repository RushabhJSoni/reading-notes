## Objects

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

## IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME

KNOWN AS PROPERTIES

If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property. Properties te ll us about the object, such as
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
Each individual hotel might have a different name
and a different number of rooms.

## The Document Object Model (DOM)

specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
